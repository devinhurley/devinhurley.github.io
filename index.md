### CPSC 120


* Lab 1


   Lab 1, was a favorite of mine because it was the very first assignment we did in this lab and set the groundwork for the rest of the semester. Being the first lab, it was the most detailed which made it much simpler compared to other labs. This lab introduced us to the basics of coding and had us apply these concepts for the first time.


* Lab 7


   Lab 7, part 2 was another favorite of mine because it used a game that I have played many times (blackjack) and had us code it. I have played Blackjack a lot in my life and I was especially interested in this lab because of my familiarity to the game. I found it fascinating how the code could determine the vastly different values of Aces (that being either 1 or 11) and how they played into each hand.


* Lab 9


   Lab 9, was another favorite because it was one of the first ones that actually made sense to me. This course has been somewhat difficult for me as I am bad with computers and for whatever reason I just was not retaining the knowledge taught in lecture. Lab 9, where we made an algorithm for Olympic Judges and solved the Philosphers dining problem, was one of the few that stood out as not being too difficult.
